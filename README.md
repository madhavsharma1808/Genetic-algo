Survival of the fittest:

The theory of evolution by natural selection is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits.

Suppose a certain species that use Camouflage to hide from the predaors reside in trees ,so the one with color similar to the tree will survive because they will remain unseen by the predator.
